The normal distribution
=======================

The ***normal distribution***, also known as the ***Gaussian***, refers
to the mathematical function used to describe the bell-shaped curve of
expected values for any measurement subject to small random errors.
Probably most of you have already seen this distribution before, and
here we briefly outline its definition and use.

Many geological values can be described using the *normal distribution*,
where the most common measured values are proximal to the *mean*, but
small numbers of measurements may have values quite far from the mean.
The example in Figure 5 is for the slope angles of cinder cones, which
may be expected to be similar in many cases. This might relate to the
angle of repose of the cinders that form the cone.

|The normal distribution and standard deviations|\  *Figure 6. The
relationships between the normal distribution and standard deviation.

Assuming we have a representative sample, the *standard deviation* can
be related to the percentage of measurements that would be expected to
fall within some distance from the *mean*. If the sample is
representative, the sample mean *x*-bar and population mean *Âµ* should
be the same. In this case, ~68% of measurements should be within
plus/minus one standard deviation of the mean, and ~95% should fall
within plus/minus two standard deviations.

You will learn more about the *normal distribution* in the exercise for
this week.
