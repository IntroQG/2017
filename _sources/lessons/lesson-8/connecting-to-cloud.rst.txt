Connecting to the cloud computer instances
==========================================

Having moved to a new computer classroom, we'll now need to slightly
alter how we connect to the cloud computers.

Linux (Ubuntu 14.04)
--------------------

1. If this is the first time connecting, open a Terminal window (click
   Ubuntu icon on top left, enter "Terminal" in search box) and type

   .. code:: bash

       $ vinagre

   This will open the default Ubuntu Remote Desktop Viewer
   (**Vinagre**). You can right-click on the icon and select **Lock to
   Launcher** to keep the icon there for future classes.
2. After **Vinagre** opens, you can click on the **Connect** button on
   the top left to make a new connection.

-  Select **VNC** for the Protocol
-  Enter the IP of the remote computer, plus the port number as the
   host: ``XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:5901``
-  I suggest you tick the boxes for **Fullscreen** and **Scaling**,
   which will make the window fill the screen. You should also leave the
   box for **Keep aspect ratio** ticked.
-  At this point you can click the **Connect** button.

**Note**: To exit full screen mode, press the **F11** key.

Windows 7
---------

Remote Desktop Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Click on Windows start button.
2. Enter "Remote Desktop Connection" in search window.
3. `Connect as
   usual <https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Lesson-1-Course-Environment/blob/master/Background/connect-win-rdp.md>`__.

TightVNC
~~~~~~~~

The TightVNC client should be available in Windows on these computers,
so you should be able to `connect the same way we have
previously <https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Lesson-1-Course-Environment/blob/master/Background/connect-win-vnc.md>`__.

**Next**: `Exercise 8: Coding and visualizing
geostatistics <https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/dfe30092c1bc8f4030d081d77c33ea0a>`__\ 
**Home**: `Lesson 8 main
page <https://github.com/Intro-Quantitative-Geology/Lesson-8-Basic-geostatistics>`__\ 
**Previous**: `The normal distribution <normal-distribution.md>`__
